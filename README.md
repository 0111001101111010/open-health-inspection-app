__How to contribute__
* You'll need to install NodeJS, which can be found [here](nodejs.org).  
* Run these commands in project root:
  * npm install -g grunt-cli
  * npm install
  * grunt watch

Now when you make edits to CSS or JS, they are automatically concatenated and minified in css/build/ and js/build/.  Images are losslessly optimized in img/build/.
